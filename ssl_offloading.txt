1. Would like to monitor every possible metrics such as CPU, RAM as these metrics decide the processing power of the server.
2. However, the NICs to be monitored very closely & frequently in this scenario as it is the entry/exit point of the server which receives encypted traffic & delivers decrypted traffics.
3. Various monitoring tools available such as Zabbix,Grafana/Promethus & Datadog etc to monitor, according to our feasibility we can choose any of the monitoring tools.
4. However we can monitor these metrics by logging into the server itself if we have a terminal option.
